# auto_mpg_dataset
Regression task for Auto-MPG dataset using different regression models and evaluating their performance along with 
feature selection using Recursive Feature Selection, Forward Feature Selection and also using correlation matrix and
heatmaps to select non-redundant features/attributes from the dataset and then evaluating model metrics

Python 3 file- 'AutoMPG-Neural_Network_Regressor.py' contains code for evaluating and training a neural network regressor,
while 'Auto_MPG-Regression.py' contains codes for file preprocessing using 'fancyimpute' package for imputing missing values
in input CSV file followed by data preprocessing steps and having multiple regression algorithms using cross-validation
